# EDDY

Eddy is a quantitative decision making app which tells you the best choice to make based on what's most important to you.

Users input the options available to them, the attributes they need to factor into making a decision, and assign scores for each attribute for each option. Then, our algorithm evaluates the suitability of each option based on these weighted attributes.

This was developed for the 2020 SYNCS Hackathon by Ada Luong, Angeni Bai, Edwina Adisusila, Giuliana de Bellis and Andre Georgis.
